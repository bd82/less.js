/**
 *  A Note About CSS Syntax
 *
 *  CSS, as far as syntax is defined in https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/,
 *  is somewhat confusing the first 50 times you read it, probably because
 *  it contains some ambiguities and inherent self-contradictions due to
 *  it's legacy nature. It also has no specific "spec" to draw from.
 *
 *  CSS essentially is not one spec of syntax and grammar, but is, in fact,
 *  a collection of specs of syntax and grammar, some of which can mean that
 *  parsing rules are potentially contradictory.
 * 
 *  For example, if you were to just parse: `foo:bar {}`, if you just went by
 *  the syntax spec alone, there's no way to resolve this. Property values
 *  (according to spec), may have `{}` as a value, and pseudo-selectors may start
 *  with a colon. So this may be a property of `foo` with a value of `bar {}`
 *  or it may be the selector `foo:bar` with a set of rules in `{}`.
 * 
 *  Another example: qualified rules are supposed to gulp everything up to `{}`,
 *  including a semi-colon. Meaning `foo:bar; {}` is valid. It's an invalid
 *  _selector_, but it's not a parsing error. Or is it a valid declaration
 *  followed by an empty curly block (which is also valid)? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 * 
 *  This means that any pre-processor like Less, Sass, or PostCSS, using nested
 *  syntax, can never be a 100% spec-compliant CSS parser. AFAICT, there is no
 *  such thing.
 * 
 *  However, in this CSS parser and parsers that extend it, we can intelligently
 *  resolve this ambiguity with these principles:
 *    1. There are no element selectors that start with '--'
 *    2. There are no currently-defined CSS properties that have a {} block as a 
 *       possible value. (If this ever happens, every CSS parser is screwed.)
 *  This is essentially what browsers do: that is, they choose parts of the CSS
 *  grammar they can "understand". It's _browsers_ (and convention) and not the
 *  spec that allows declarations in certain places. So, currently, declarations
 *  at the root don't _mean_ anything, but if they did someday, it would not be
 *  a violation of current grammar.
 * 
 *  CSS grammar is extremely permissive to allow modularity of the syntax and
 *  future expansion. Basically, anything "unknown", including unknown tokens,
 *  does not necessarily mean a parsing error of the stylesheet itself. For
 *  example, the contents of an at-rule body (defined in a "{}") has no explicit
 *  definition, but is instead left up to the spec for that particular at rule.
 *  That means you could end up with some future at-rule like:
 *     `@future {!!:foo > ; > ?bar}`
 *  A case like that is _unlikely_, but the point is any CSS parser that lives
 *  outside of the browser, in order to be maintainable, must parse what it
 *  _can_, but preserve anything it doesn't explicitly define. A non-browser
 *  stylesheet parser should return warnings, but should recover all errors.

/**
 *  Parsing is broken into 2 phases, so that we:
 *    1. Don't have to do any backtracking to refine rules (like @media).
 *    2. Don't have to have special parsing rules based on block context.
 * 
 *  This actually matches the spec, which essentially says that preludes and
 *  at-rule bodies (in {}) can be almost anything, and the outer grammar should
 *  not care about what at-rules or declaration values contain.
